# Ironfeather
A personal lab for learning and experimentation at the intersection of data, research, and applied AI — with a focus on science-driven questions and societal impact.

This repository is a personal learning and experimentation space focused on data analysis, research methods, and applied AI.

My background is in quantitative research and analytics, and I am currently building technical depth in Python, data science, and machine learning with the goal of transitioning into science-driven and research-oriented projects.

## Areas of interest
- Data analysis and visualization (Python, pandas)
- Statistical reasoning and modeling
- Applied machine learning
- Research workflows and reproducibility
- Applications in science, energy, and health

## Current focus
- Strengthening Python and pandas fundamentals
- Building small, well-documented analysis projects
- Preparing for hackathons and academic applications

This repository will evolve over time as I deepen my technical and scientific skills.
